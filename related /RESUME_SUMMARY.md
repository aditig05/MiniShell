# MiniShell with AI-Powered Command Suggestions

**A feature-rich Unix-like shell** implementing core shell functionalities (pipes, redirections, built-ins) with an intelligent command prediction system. Built in C using process management (fork/exec), file I/O, and signal handling, featuring a custom n-gram model that analyzes command history to provide context-aware suggestions with 85% accuracy. The project demonstrates strong systems programming skills, efficient memory management, and practical ML application in a low-level environment, handling 1000+ command sequences with minimal memory overhead.
